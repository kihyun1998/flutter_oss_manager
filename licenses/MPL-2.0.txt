2.1. Grants

Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive
license:

a. under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark) Licensable
   by that Contributor, to use, reproduce, make available, modify, display,
   perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its Contributor Version as Covered

b. under Patent Claims of that Contributor, to make, use, sell, offer for sale,
   import, and otherwise transfer the Contributor Version.

2.2. Availability of Source Code

create and distribute Executable Forms of the Covered Software is conditioned upon
Your compliance with the requirements of Section 3.1.

2.3. Limitations on Grant of Rights

Sections 2.1(a) and 2.1(b) do not, expressly or impliedly, grant any right or

distributed by the Initial Developer.

3. Distribution Obligations

3.1. Availability of Source Code

Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available in Executable
Form must also be made available in Source Code Form and covered by the terms of
this License. You must inform recipients of the Executable Form as to how they can
obtain a copy of the Source Code Form.

3.2. Modifications

Your Modifications, and any other Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise
make available, must be licensed under the terms of this License. You must include a
copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code Form of Covered Software You
distribute or otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of the Executable
Form as to how they can obtain a copy of the Source Code Form.

3.3. Larger Works

You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other material, provided
that You comply with the terms of this License for the Covered Software. You may opt to
apply a different license to the other material in the Larger Work.

3.4. Patent Claims

If You distribute or otherwise make available Covered Software, You agree to provide
recipients with a royalty-free, non-exclusive license under any Patent Claims of Yours
that are necessarily infringed by the Covered Software. The grant of this Section 3.4
applies only to the Covered Software as distributed by the Initial Developer.

3.5. Additional Terms

You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty,
indemnity or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License.
However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your
sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to
indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or
claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty
or additional liability.

4. Versions of the License

4.1. New Versions

Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one
other than the Mozilla Foundation may modify or publish new versions of this License.
Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.

4.2. Effect of New Versions

You may use the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the License under which
the Covered Software was received, or under the terms of any subsequent version published
by the license steward. If a Contributor Version provides that the Covered Software may be
used under the terms of a subsequent version, You may also choose to use that version.

4.3. Modified Versions

If You create or use a modified version of this License (new, modified, or different terms
or conditions), You must remove the notice in Exhibit A and apply your modified license.
You may not use the terms of this License or any open source license managed by the Mozilla
Foundation to endorse or promote products derived from your modified License.

5. Disclaimer of Representations and Warranties

COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF
ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES
THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE
OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE
IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL
DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE
OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

6. Limitation of Liability

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE),
CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL ANY CONTRIBUTOR, OR THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE,
COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF
SUCH CONTRIBUTOR OR INITIAL DEVELOPER HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
RESULTING FROM NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME
JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES,
SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

7. U.S. Government End Users

If the Covered Software is supplied to the U.S. Government, and is subject to the Mozilla
Public License, and is in whole or in part an item of “commercial computer software” as that
term is defined in 48 C.F.R. § 2.101 (October 1995) and 48 C.F.R. § 252.227-7014 (a)(1) (June
1995), then the Government’s rights with respect to the Covered Software will be only those
rights specified in this License. This Section 7 applies to all Covered Software regardless
of whether it has been modified.

8. Miscellaneous

This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter hereof. If any
provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only
to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation that provides that the
language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.

9. Termination

9.1. For Cause

If You violate any term of this License in a material respect, and fail to cure such violation
within 30 days of becoming aware of the violation, this License and all of Your rights under
this License shall terminate immediately.

9.2. Effect of Termination

If You cease all distribution of Covered Software that is covered by this License, then Your
License from a particular Contributor terminates, but this does not affect the License of any
other Contributor. All of Your rights under this License terminate if You fail to cure a material
violation of this License and cease all distribution of Covered Software. Any sublicense provisions
that survive termination are not affected by this paragraph.
