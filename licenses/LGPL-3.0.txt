GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0

Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and
conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the
additional permissions listed below.

0. Additional Definitions.

As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General
Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public
License.

"The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an
Executable Program as defined below.

An "Executable Program" is any work produced by compiling or interpreting a
covered work that is not a Library, in such a way that it requires the Library
to be present for execution.

"A Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an instance of the
Library with an Executable Program. The particular terms of the GNU GPL that
apply to the Combined Work are those that apply to the Executable Program.

"Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source
for the Executable Program, excluding any source code for the Library.

"Corresponding Application Binary" for a Combined Work means the object code and
executable form of the Executable Program, including any data and utility programs
needed for its execution, but excluding the Library.

1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without
being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

2. Conveying Modified Versions.

If you modify a copy of the Library, and you convey it as a modified work, you
must fulfill all the obligations of the GNU GPL, including section 4, for the
modified version of the Library, and you must also do the following:

a) The modified work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it,
and giving a relevant date.

b) The modified work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released
under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement
modifies the requirement in section 4 to "keep intact all notices".

c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone
who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along
with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and
all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no
permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such
permission if you have received it separately.

d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display an
"Appropriate Legal Notices" notice; but if the Program has interactive
interfaces that do not display an "Appropriate Legal Notices" notice, your
work need not make them do so.

A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which
are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not
combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage
or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate". The aggregate does not have
to have a license applied to it by this License. However, if you include a
covered work in an aggregate, the covered work continues to be governed by this
License.

3. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4
and 5, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a
physical distribution medium), or in a medium customarily used for public
interchange, or in a medium customarily used for software interchange.

b) Convey all the Corresponding Source for a covered work in object code form
under the terms of this License, in one of the ways specified in section 4.

c) Convey the Installation Information, if any, in a way that gives users access
to install and execute modified versions of the covered work in the User Product
from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object code is
in no case prevented or interfered with merely because modification has been made.

4. Additional Terms.

"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this License by
making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions
that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were
included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law.
If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be
used separately under those permissions, provided the rest of the Program is
used under this License. Nothing in this License grants permission to run the
Program in any other way.

When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any
additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional
permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when
you modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by
you to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright
permission.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a
covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material)
supplement the terms of this License with terms:

a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of
sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

b) Requiring preservation of specified legal notices or author attributions in
that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works containing
the material; or

c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring
that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as differing
from the original version; or

d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names or trademarks of the
authors or licensors of the material; or

e) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone
who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions
of liability to the recipient, for any liability that the contractual assumptions
of liability entail.

All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further restrictions"
within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any
covered work to which you convey it, contains such further restrictions, you must
remove those restrictions before conveying it. You may not convey a covered work
if you are a party to an arrangement that deals with the distribution of the
software, under which you make payment to the third party for the exercise of the
right to convey the software, and under which the third party grants, to any party
who receives the software, a discriminatory patent license (a) in connection with
copies of the software conveyed by you (b) under patent claims that are infringed
by the software, combined with the software, or by the software's use.

5. Termination.

You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under
this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent
licenses granted under the second paragraph of section 11).

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a
particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the
copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently,
if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by any reasonable
means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently
if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this
is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any
work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the patent licenses
of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If a
work is terminated and ceases to be a covered work, in whole or in part, the
parties who have received copies of that work from you under this License will not
have their licenses terminated so long as they remain in full compliance. However,
nothing in this section purports to revoke or alter any other permissions that may
be had of the work.

6. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of
the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a
consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not
require acceptance. However, nothing in this License grants you permission to
propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work,
you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

7. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license
from the original licensors, to run, modify, and propagate that work, subject to
this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties
with this License.

8. Patents.

A "contributor version" is a work that has been contributed to the Program.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each contributor grants to
you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license to make, use, sell,
offer for sale, import, and otherwise transfer the contributor version, where
such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such contributor
that are necessarily infringed by their contributor version alone or by
combination of their contributor version with the Program (or a work based on
the Program) to which the contributor version was contributed.

If you institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or
counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that a contributor version is infringing patent
claims, then any patent licenses granted to you by that contributor under this
License for that contributor version automatically terminate.

A patent license is also terminated if you are a party to an arrangement that
deals with the distribution of the software, under which you make payment to the
third party for the exercise of the right to convey the software, and under which
the third party grants, to any party who receives the software, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the software conveyed by you (b)
under patent claims that are infringed by the software, combined with the software,
or by the software's use.

9. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise)
that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the
conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy
simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if
you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for onward propagation
of the Program, and the only way you could satisfy that term is to violate this
License, then you must not propagate the Program.

10. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link
or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero
General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting
work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the
covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License
will apply to the combined work as a whole.

11. Revised Versions of this License.

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU
Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar
in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems
or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies
that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any
later version" applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of
the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.

12. Disclaimer of Warranty.

THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY
AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU
ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

13. Limitation of Liability.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY
COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS
PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE
THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM
TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

14. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be
given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply
local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability
in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies
a copy of the Program in return for a fee.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to
the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone
can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program.
It is safest to attach them to the start of every source file
to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file
should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is located.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU Lesser General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program does not do interactive graphics but runs in a text mode, it is
a good idea to print a notice like this:

  <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

  This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
  This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
  under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

If you have GNU Emacs, it's a good idea to install the `dir' command and then
use `M-x add-file-local-variable' to add `mode: doc; fill-column: 75;' to the
file.

For information on why the GNU Lesser General Public License and GNU Affero
General Public License are sometimes better than the GNU General Public License,
